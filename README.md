**This is a non-functional work in progress. Don't rely on this for anything.**

## Security Warning

This implementation is NOT secure, but the iMessage protocol isn't either. As is apparent from the seamless user experience, they don't have true E2EE.

## Why?

iMessage is a proprietary messaging protocol and service used by Apple.

Apple's [somewhat malicious]() [refusal]() to open it up in any way, as well as their [bullying strategy]() has ticked people off.

[pypush]() is a reverse engineering effort, but it's not something people are meant to use.

blueShim aims to enable robust alternatives to Apple's proprietary clients.

## Protocol

A documentation of the protocol is in the works.
